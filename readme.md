📝 PyEdit — A Terminal-Based Text Editor in Python

PyEdit is a lightweight, Vim-inspired terminal text editor written in Python using the curses library.
It supports multiple editing modes, cursor movement, file saving, and command-based controls — all inside your terminal window.

🚀 Features

✔️ Vim-like modes: Normal, Insert, Command

✔️ Open & edit existing files

✔️ Cursor navigation (arrows or HJKL)

✔️ Save, quit, force quit—just like Vim

✔️ Lightweight & terminal-native

✔️ Cross-platform support (with windows-curses on Windows)

🔧 Installation
🖥 Windows Users

Windows does NOT include curses by default, so install this first:

pip install windows-curses

🐧 Linux / macOS

No setup required — curses is already included with Python.

▶️ Running the Editor
Start the editor:
python main.py

Open a specific file:
python main.py notes.txt

⌨️ Keybindings
NORMAL Mode

i — Enter INSERT mode

x — Delete character under cursor

: — Enter COMMAND mode

q — Quit (press twice if unsaved changes)

Arrow keys / h j k l — Move cursor

INSERT Mode

ESC — Return to NORMAL mode

ENTER — Insert a new line

Backspace — Delete character

COMMAND Mode (:)

:w — Save file

:q — Quit if no unsaved changes

:q! — Force quit without saving

:wq — Save & quit
This happens on Windows.
✔️ Fix:

pip install windows-curses
